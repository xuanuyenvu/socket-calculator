The Socket Calculator project is a simple client-server application written in C++. This application allows one server to connect with multiple clients over a network connection.

## Description

The Socket Calculator project enables clients to send mathematical expressions to the server for evaluation. The server performs basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) on the expressions and sends back the results to the clients. If a client enters an invalid syntax, the server responds with an error message.
- One server can handle connections from multiple clients simultaneously.
- Clients can send mathematical expressions to the server for computation.
- The server evaluates the expressions and sends the results back to the clients.
- In case of invalid input syntax, the server notifies the client of the error.
